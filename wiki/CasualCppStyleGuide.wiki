#summary How to format your code while writing in C++ on this project.


A very rough draft of our C++ style guide. Will add examples and more detailed explanations later.

== Headers ==
Use header files. Please, *please do not, under any circumstances, import .cpp files.*


== Comments ==

Give your functions function header comments. Be sure to include whatever a new member would need to know about the function (assumptions, specialty behavior, etc).

Give your classes a class header comment. Include what other members would need to know to to use the class effectively. 

In line comments should be used to describe behavior of blocks of code.

== White space ==
Indent your code properly (or let your IDE of choice format it for you).

Separate blocks of code with one line of white space.

== This Style Guide ==
Update the style guide (or email a team lead) when you see a style convention in the code base that you didn't know before.
