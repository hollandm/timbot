#summary I just set up OpenCV on my Ubuntu machine, here is how I did it.

Last year I had to install this stuff way to many times. This year I'm going to document things.

*Step 1: Install OpenCV.*

I found a number of download scripts and such that did not work. The one that ended up working for me was at http://opencvstart.blogspot.com/2012/12/install-opencv-in-ubuntu-1204.html. This script installed all the prerequisites for compiling and installing OpenCV and then precoded to download the source, build it, and then install it.

*Step 2: Set up Compilation script*

Compiling a program that uses OpenCV requires a lot of extra fluff. I modified a script that I found to compile said programs quickly. The original script can be found here, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV.

*Step 3: Run a test program*

Next it would probably be wise to test the installation and make sure everything is working.

*Step 4: Have fun*
