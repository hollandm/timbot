#summary How to format your code while writing in C++ on this project.


A very rough draft of our c++ style guide. Will add examples and more detailed explanations later.

== Headers ==
Any program whose source code is more than one file *must* make use of header files. Under no circumstances are you ever to import a cpp file.

== Comments ==

Every function must have a function header comment.
Every class must have a class header comment.

In line comments should be used to describe behaviour of blocks of code.

== White space ==
All files must be properly indented. 

Blocks of code should have one line of white space separating them.
