Here instructions on how to setup the robot.

Router:
0. Plug in the router

Robot:
1. Plug the smart motors and bucket arduino into the bot top
2. Log into the bot top, the password is timbot2
3. Open terminal, start->System Tools->xterm
4. Type the following commands in terminal to enable read write access to the arduino and motors. Enter will run them.
    (if you unplug them you will need to repeat this step)
    sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
    sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyACM0
5. Run the following command to get to the directory with the demo program
    cd ~/svn/timbot/trunk/timbot/Demos/E-Week/Robot/
6. Connect the bot top to the network (Click bars icon in bottom right corner of screen)
7. Begin the program with the following command
    python main.py
8. Close the computer, and the case. Twist the E-stop button to power the robot.

Control Program:
9. Switch to the old grey laptop. It doesn't have a password, just hit enter when it asks you for one.
10. The battery dies in about 20 seconds so plug it in.
11. Plug the joysticks into the computer.
12. Connect the computer to the network "UP Robotics"
13. Click on joysticks.py on the Desktop
14. On the joystick that you intend to control the right wheels with hit the 5 button so the software knows which joystick is which.

Everything should now be set up

Here are the controls.

Pushing the Left joystick forwards and backwards should drive the left wheels forward or backwards.
Pushing the Right joystick forwards and backwards should drive the right wheels forward or backwards.
Tapping the trigger on the right joystick should have the robot drive forward until the IR sensors detect that they are about to hit something.
When the robot is in it's autonomous drive forward mode button 4 on the right joystick should act as a stop button.
Button 4 on the right joystick  also resets the motors.
